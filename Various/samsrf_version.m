% This function used to include a 3rd output for the version of Octave support.
% Unsurprisingly, Sam is way too busy & life is too short for this & so the
% plan to improve Octave compatibility has been abandoned. I am not sad
% about this except that this means the excellent name SamOaSrf will never
% be used now. Fingers crossed that MapSrf will instead become a reality...
